# NYC Crash Data Exploration

Except for the first question, use the cleaned crash data in feather format.

    a.  Construct a contigency table for missing in geocode (latitude and
     longitude) by borough. Is the missing pattern the same across boroughs?
     Formulate a hypothesis and test it. 



    a.  Construct a `hour` variable with integer values from 0 to 23. Plot the
     histogram of the number of crashes by `hour`. Plot it by borough.


     
    a.  Overlay the locations of the crashes on a map of NYC. The map could be a
     static map or a Google map.



    a.  Create a new variable `severe` which is one if the number of persons
     injured or deaths is 1 or more; and zero otherwise. Construct a cross
     table for `severe` versus borough. Is the severity of the crashes the
     same across boroughs? Test the null hypothesis that the two variables
     are not associated with an appropriate test.



    a.  Merge the crash data with the Census zip code database which
   contains zip-code level demographic or socioeconomic variables.



    a.  Fit a logistic model with `severe` as the outcome variable and covariates
     that are available in the data or can be engineered from the data. For
     example, zip code level covariates obtained from merging with the
     zip code database; crash hour; number of vehicles involved.
